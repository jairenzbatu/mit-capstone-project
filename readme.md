**TIER 4 CLOUD DISASTER RECOVERY STRATEGY THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE: A MODEL FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE PHILIPPINES**  

#### Capstone Abstract  

With the increasing reliance of organizations and enterprises on information systems, the need for robust disaster recovery planning has become paramount. This study investigates the implementation of disaster recovery strategies within the cloud, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of Backup and Restore, Pilot Light, and Warm Standby approaches. The research highlights that even organizations with limited budgets can adopt effective disaster recovery solutions that meet industry standards. By utilizing Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, IT managers can automate the recovery process, ensuring rapid restoration of services while maintaining data integrity.  

The findings reveal that while the Warm Standby strategy offers the quickest recovery times, both the Pilot Light and Backup and Restore strategies are more cost-effective, making them suitable starting points for organizations looking to enhance their disaster recovery capabilities. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between data size, sample count, and recovery time to choose the most appropriate strategy. Ultimately, the results highlight the necessity for organizations to prioritize disaster recovery planning as a critical component of their overall IT strategy, ensuring resilience in the face of potential disruptions.
